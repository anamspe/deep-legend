# Deep Legend 

**Deep Legend** is a web platform designed to streamline the translation workflow for content creators and subtitlers. It allows users to input formatted captions (such as `.srt` subtitle files or timestamped scripts) and receive translations while preserving the original structure.

## 🚧 Status: Work in Progress

This project is in early development. Current focus:
- Creating the main layout and input/output interface
- Building .srt parser and formatter logic
- Integrating AI-powered translation (OpenAI API or DeepL API planned)
- Future: file <s>upload</s>✅/export, backend processing with Node.js

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js (planned)
- OpenAI API or DeepL API (planned)

## 📌 Goals

- Seamless translation of subtitle files without losing formatting
- Support for creators localizing YouTube videos, TV shows, tutorials, etc.
- Easy-to-use UI with accurate, AI-assisted results
