# Deep Legend 

**Deep Legend** is a web platform designed to streamline the translation workflow for content creators and subtitlers. It allows users to input formatted captionsâ€”such as `.srt` subtitle files or timestamped scriptsâ€”and receive translations while preserving the original structure.

This project is in early development. Current focus:
- Creating the main layout and input/output interface
- Building .srt parser and formatter logic
- Integrating AI-powered translation (OpenAI API or DeepL API planned)
- Future: file upload/export, backend processing with Node.js

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js (planned)
- OpenAI API or DeepL API (planned)

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Seamless translation of subtitle files without losing formatting
- Support for creators localizing YouTube videos, TV shows, tutorials, etc.
- Easy-to-use UI with accurate, AI-assisted results
